The Lion Design System is created using the Style Guide Guide created by Brad Frost as a boilerplate for hetras' Style Guide.

[Brad Frost's Demo Here](http://bradfrost.github.io/style-guide-guide/)

## How it works
Style Guide Guide is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which works quite well for managing the content of a style guide.

The tool can consume and display components from anywhere. 

## Getting Started
1. Download or clone the files from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/bradstrix/styleguide).
2. In the command line, navigate to the root of the project and run the `jekyll serve` command. This will build the static site and watch for changes.
3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser to see the style guide.
